# Wine-classification-using-KNN-and-SVM-classifier
1.Input Variables:

fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile
volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine
citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops
chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine
free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion
total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02
density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic)
sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels
alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine
Output Variable:

quality: output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10)
